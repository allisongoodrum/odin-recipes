            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I lifted this recipe from the New York Times, which is
                    unfortunately behind a paywall. But no need to worry
                    because I wrote it down for you here! You cannot copywrite
                    a recipe so come at me, NYT. Anyway, here is how to make
                    tumeric spiced chickpea stew. It comes together in under
                    an hour and feeds four people. I like to make it on
                    Soup Sundays.
