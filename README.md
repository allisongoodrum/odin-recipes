# odin-recipes
This will be a compilation of my recipes that I've likely lifted from Kenji Lopez-Alt and a handful of NYT food contributors. 

Goals:
-improve file management proficency 
-make html boilerplate second nature
-combine img and html with ease
-use best practices
-compile my usual recipes
